Web of Trust Version 0.4.4 build0019
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

As the previous build was mostly new code to improve performance, the
main focus of this release shall be bugfixes and unit tests.
Alternating between new code and maintenance hopefully guarantees the
quality of the codebase to flourish.
To not give you a boring release without apparent changes, the build
also ships improvements of the user interface; and an optimization of
startup time.
For developers, there is a special goodie available: I have released
my bachelor's thesis about last year's WoT performance work.
The thesis contains a large introduction which explains how WoT works.
As it is intended for an audience with no prior Freenet-related
knowledge, it shall be considered as the WoT core developer's manual.
There are also open algorithmic questions outlined in the thesis
- so if you want to do some computer science, please have a look at it,
feedback is welcome.

FIXME: Summarize the actual changes which have been outlined above.


Outlook for the next build: The missing piece in the "first round" of
the most promising performance improvements is planned to ship in the
next build:
Currently, WoT creates an USK subscription for all of the known
identities, which amounts to over 14 000. This puts very heavy load on a
typical Freenet node.
The fix will address this by only subscribing to the identities which
the user has assigned trust to. The other identities will only be
fetched "on-demand" when WoT learns by gossip that they surely have
published a new edition.
For details of the planned algorithm, see [1].

Work on this shall being immediately, but it may take some months as
I've been volunteer since December and thus cannot provide as much time
as an employee anymore.
This is because Freenet has run out of funds. I am currently not seeking
a different job at the hope of being able to acquire funding for Freenet
so I can resume work. This can continue for some months, as my family
needs some help from me anyway and I get food in return, but I cannot
live off my family's gratitude forever.

HOW TO INSTALL:

While this release has not yet been bundled with a new Freenet
release, it can be acquired a lot easier than previous non-bundled
ones:
1) Unload the "WebOfTrust" plugin and load the "WebOfTrust Testing
   Versions" plugin. Please do first read the description for the
   security implications!
2) If you had already done step 1 previously, i.e. are already running
   a previous testing release, you need to restart Freenet or unload
   and re-load the plugin for getting the update: Freenet will only
   check for updates of the testing version when the plugin is
   restarted.
You will also get this release someday even if you do not switch to the
testing versions. It will just take longer: Non-testing releases are
shipped together with regular Freenet releases; and Freenet releases do
not happen as often as WoT releases.
So once Freenet build 1473 is released, no action will be needed
anymore, your node will update WoT automatically.

- 0006653: [Bugs] IdentityFileProcessor can get triggered during early
           startup, slows it down (xor)

  The previous build's changelog promised an improved startup time of
  WoT of 2 minutes.
  Unfortunately, in practice, a bug could cause this to become over 20
  minutes.

  This bug has been fixed, and startup times of 2 minutes should in fact
  be possible now.

  This is of course still too much. The next build's work shall reduce
  this to almost zero startup time.
  See https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3816

- 0006663: [Performance] Enforce maximum numer of trust values when
           importing trust lists (xor)

  When WoT uploads trust lists to the network, there is a limit of 512
  trust values. If you set more trust values than 512, only 512 of them
  will be exported.

  Unfortunately, this limit was not enforced when importing trust lists
  which were downloaded from the network. Thus, a malicious user could
  upload trust lists with much more trust values to conduct a denial of
  service attack on the network.
  Luckily, this was not a real security issue, since there was still
  an indirect limit:
  The file size of trust lists was properly limited to 1 MB.
  Still, a lot of trust values can fit in 1 MB, which is why this caused
  noticeable performance issues.

  This build fixes import to ignore trust lists with more than 512
  entries.
  This could have an impact on 3rd party clients such as LCWoT: If they
  only ever produce trust lists that large, their identities will be
  ignored by WoT.
  Thus, if you're an author of a 3rd party client, please fix it to
  limit the amount of exported trust values to 512.

  Blah.

- 0006840: [Code quality] Provide xor's WoT bachelor thesis as a developer's manual (xor)
- 0006815: [Code quality] l10n: Add config for Transifex command line
           tool "tx" (xor)

  Translations nowadays are being managed on a collaborative website:
  https://www.transifex.com/

  They offer a command line tool called "tx" for downloading and
  uploading translations. The tool is open source and available in
  package management of Ubuntu for example.
  Hence a configuration file for the tool was added to the WoT
  repository. It can be found in the ".tx" directory where tx expects
  it.

  To use the tool, it is recommended to use the "transifex-pull" script
  from our scripts repository: https://github.com/freenet/scripts
  Please make sure to first read the manual at the beginning of the
  tool's Python source code.
