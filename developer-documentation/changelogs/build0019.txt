Web of Trust Version 0.4.4 build0019
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

As the previous build was mostly new code to improve performance, the
main focus of this release shall be bugfixes and unit tests.
Alternating between new code and maintenance hopefully guarantees the
quality of the codebase to flourish.
To not give you a boring release without apparent changes, the build
also ships improvements of the user interface; and an optimization of
startup time.

FIXME: Summarize the actual changes which have been outlined above.


Outlook for the next build: The missing piece in the "first round" of
the most promising performance improvements is planned to ship in the
next build:
Currently, WoT creates an USK subscription for all of the known
identities, which amounts to over 14 000. This puts very heavy load on a
typical Freenet node.
The fix will address this by only subscribing to the identities which
the user has assigned trust to. The other identities will only be
fetched "on-demand" when WoT learns by gossip that they surely have
published a new edition.
For details of the planned algorithm, see [1].

Work on this shall being immediately, but it may take some months as
I've been volunteer since December and thus cannot provide as much time
as an employee anymore.
This is because Freenet has run out of funds. I am currently not seeking
a different job at the hope of being able to acquire funding for Freenet
so I can resume work. This can continue for some months, as my family
needs some help from me anyway and I get food in return, but I cannot
live off my family's gratitude forever.

Bitcoin is also accepted in case you want to stay semi-anonymous!


HOW TO INSTALL:

While this release has not yet been bundled with a new Freenet
release, it can be acquired a lot easier than previous non-bundled
ones:
1) Unload the "WebOfTrust" plugin and load the "WebOfTrust Testing
   Versions" plugin. Please do first read the description for the
   security implications!
2) If you had already done step 1 previously, i.e. are already running
   a previous testing release, you need to restart Freenet or unload
   and re-load the plugin for getting the update: Freenet will only
   check for updates of the testing version when the plugin is
   restarted.
You will also get this release someday even if you do not switch to the
testing versions. It will just take longer: Non-testing releases are
shipped together with regular Freenet releases; and Freenet releases do
not happen as often as WoT releases.
So once Freenet build 1473 is released, no action will be needed
anymore, your node will update WoT automatically.
